    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaways from this section include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neural networks are powerful models that can be customized and tweaked using various amounts of nodes, layers, ...\n",
    "* The most basic neural networks are single-layer densely connected neural networks, which have very similar properties as logistic regression models\n",
    "* Compared to more traditional statistics and ML techniques, neural networks perform particularly well when using unstructured data\n",
    "* Apart from densely connected networks, other types of neural networks include convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and generative adversarial neural networks \n",
    "* When working with image data, it's important to understand how image data is stored when working with them in Python\n",
    "* Logistic regression can be seen as a single-layer neural network with a sigmoid activation function\n",
    "* Neural networks use loss and cost functions to minimize the \"loss\", which is a function that summarizes the difference between the actual outcome (eg. pictures contain santa or not) and the model prediction (whether the model correctly identifies pictures with santas)\n",
    "* Backward and forward propagation are used to estimate the so-called \"model weights\"\n",
    "* Adding more layers to neural networks can substantially increase model performance\n",
    "* Several activations can be used in model nodes, you can explore with different types and evaluate how it affects performance"
